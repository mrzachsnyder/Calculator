# A simple calculator for people who make things.
## Overview
I still use my TI-84 graphing calculator, mostly because I've spent countless hours with it in Mechanical Engineering school. I know it like the back of my hand! I'd love to start using infinitely more powerful phone in my pocket, but the TI-84 has one specific feature that the iOS calculator doesn't: it allows you to both view and access your previous entries.

I recently learned about TypeScript and wanted to try React Native's TypeScript template, so I thought a calculator could be a fun project. My personal goal is to make something useful enough that I use it regularly while building things in my garage.

## To-Do Items
* Error handling to prevent incorrect entries e.g. ++
* Speed up button press handling function (<Button onPress{() => buttonPress(props)} /> is slow).
* Insert previous answer if operator button is pressed with empty input.
